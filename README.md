# Content Rating App

A simple React app where users can like or dislike a piece of content, built as part of the IBM Full-Stack Developer course.

## What I did
- Learned and implemented my **first custom React component** (`ContentRating.jsx`) using `useState` and `useMemo`.
- Connected event handlers to buttons to update counts dynamically.
- Practiced modern React functional component patterns.

## What was provided
- Initial Vite project setup and supporting files were from IBM's starter code.
- Styles and boilerplate code were partially provided by the lab.

## Why it's in my portfolio
- Shows my ability to **understand course material and create new features independently**.
- Demonstrates basic **state management in React**.
